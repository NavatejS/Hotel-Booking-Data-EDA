# Hotel Booking Data - Exploratory Data Analysis

In the hospitality industry, understanding customer booking behavior is crucial for operational and strategic planning. Hotels need to identify the optimal times of year to adjust room rates, the most effective length of stay for promotions, and the likelihood of special requests to enhance guest experiences. This project seeks to analyze a comprehensive dataset of hotel bookings to uncover insights that will help in predicting booking trends, customer preferences, and potential cancellation patterns. The goal is to provide actionable recommendations that hotels can implement to increase bookings, reduce cancellations, and personalize guest experiences, thereby improving overall profitability and customer satisfaction.

The primary objective of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to optimize hotel management and marketing strategies by identifying patterns and key factors that influence booking behaviors. Understanding booking trends, hotels can help optimize hotel operations, pricing strategies, and customer satisfaction. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover patterns that can assist in decision-making processes related to booking management.
